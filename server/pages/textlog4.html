    After finishing the basic classes at my college, such as calculus and physics, I started thinking about the job
    market in my field and noticed the option to work as a freelancer. At the time, the path of freelancing was shrouded
    in uncertainty and doubt since I had limited knowledge of the job market and quickly found myself overwhelmed by the
    idea of work autonomously. But after having my internship and my first job opportunity, after gaining knowledge of
    how the tech market works and what senior developers usually do, my vision became clearer, not only about freelance
    work, but about everything related to web development.

<p>
    Following my termination, I restarted my research for other job opportunities again, and among them, I found out
    about freelancing and autonomous work as a developer. With my previous job providing clarity about my career, I had
    the opportunity to start making deductions, and compare what I believe to be the differences between a
    freelancer/autonomous job and a corporation/startup job.

<p>
    In today's dynamic market landscape, the emergence of AI and the new wave of layoffs on corporate jobs has increased
    the competition and pose an additional challenge for new freelancers. It can be very difficult to start, having to
    do everything on my own not only with the code but with the client as well, not to mention it would be very
    difficult to make money in the beginning and I would need marketing skills as well. But besides the struggles, the
    promise of earning cash in a safe and global currency and gaining autonomy over my life is enough to make this worth
    trying. It might be my only chance of survival even.
</p>
<p>
    The freelance journey can make my portfolio more appealing to other companies as well, and as a matter of fact, I
    have already used some work ideas I found in Upwork to get back to working on personal projects. So even if the
    autonomous path doesn’t work well, it shouldn’t be a waste of time even if I end up working for another company
    later.
