    Firstly, I must say that my first experience with LinkedIn was beyond terrible, it took me over a year to find a
    job. This bad impression made me very cautious when I had to look for a job online again, so after being laid off, I
    started looking for jobs through connections and face-to-face meetings. This obviously didn't go very far, as I
    still don't have many connections or experience with this, not to mention that software companies usually only
    accept resumes via email. So I found myself with no other choice but to dedicate myself to LinkedIn and job websites
    again.
</p>
<p>
    I organized the notes I made while working at Mova and summarized them to place in my job experience section. What I
    did on LinkedIn during this month was quite simple, I changed the profile picture and banner to be more presentable,
    added certificates, updated college status and work experience, where I put my responsibilities and results in the
    best way I could.

<p>
    From the tips videos I watched, some that I remember using a lot for my LinkedIn in 2024 were: Jonny Viccari -
    LinkedIn 2024: Como Montar um Perfil Poderoso e Atrair Oportunidades
</p>
<p>
    With this video I had the idea of using PfpMaker to edit the background of my profile picture and I also used Canva
    to find a picture for my background banner picture, and then I saved these edits in my personal profile pictures
    folder. I also updated my keywords, with the PHP language and technologies I used at work such as Slim and HyperF.
    The rest of the tips either didn't make sense to me at the time, or were quite straightforward, such as including my
    most important certificates, websites, languages, skills, etc.

<p>
    From what I remember, there were 2 topics that I needed to do more research, to talk about myself and my job
    experience. Jonny Viccari - Como usar o CHAT GPT para criar Currículo e LinkedIn
</p>
<p>
    To write about myself, I wrote a draft of what I thought was most important, and gave it to ChatGPT to polish the
    speech to make it more professional, and then I polished the ChatGPT result again to make it more authentic. This
    experience gave me some interesting results:
</p>
<p>
    Step 1 - Raw text: “I'm Lucas Bastos, I'm a Computer Engineer from the Federal Institute, and I work with backend
    web development using PHP. I really like working with backend and this inspires me to dedicate myself more and more
    to the area. I had a lot of experience working with PHP, Slim framework, HyperF library, MySQL, documentation and
    UML standard, SCRUM methodology.”
</p>
<p>
    Step 2 - Raw ChatGPT response: Hello! I'm Lucas Bastos, a Computer Engineer graduated from the Federal Institute,
    and I work with web development with a focus on backend, especially using PHP. Throughout my professional journey, I
    focused on developing with PHP, exploring the Slim framework, the HyperF library, MySQL and following standards such
    as UML. My approach is guided by the SCRUM methodology, contributing to efficient and high-quality deliveries. I'm
    looking for new connections and collaboration opportunities. If you share interests in the area of backend
    development or just want to exchange ideas, feel free to send me a message.

    Step 3 - Edited ChatGPT response: Hello! I'm Lucas Bastos, a Computer Engineer from the Federal Institute and
    dedicated to my work with backend web development using PHP. Throughout my professional journey, I have followed
    challenging paths that have taught me the importance of discipline, collaboration and continuous learning and the
    relentless pursuit of professional growth. Currently, I'm looking for new connections and opportunities to work in
    the backend development area, to exchange ideas and grow professionally. I have experience working in development
    with PHP, exploring the Slim framework, the HyperF library, MySQL database and following UML standards, test-driven
    development (TDD) and the SCRUM methodology.
