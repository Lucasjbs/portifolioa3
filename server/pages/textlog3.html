    After updating my resume, I was thinking about what my next step would be, and eventually I decided to give the idea
    of becoming a freelancer another shot. I looked at the job opportunities at Upwork and saw one that didn't require
    too much specific knowledge to understand or do. The task was to develop a single-page website with a custom
    verification mechanism, and basically I would have to implement cookies to track the user's first interaction to the
    website on initial page load.

    Before starting the project I was returning from a long hiatus of not doing any code of my own, I was writing codes
    just for my job. So, I was rusty with programming, and that's why I thought this project was a good idea, since it
    was frameworkless and required simple web dev technologies such as PHP, JS, HTML and CSS. It was a good way to go
    back to basics and do something that is in demand in the market at the same time.
