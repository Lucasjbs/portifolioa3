    After getting fired from my first job, I had 2 things on my mind: understanding why I was fired and figuring out
    what I should do from now on. The first thing I decided to do right away was move to Joinville, as I believed I
    would have more opportunities there, and that in the worst case scenario, working with common jobs there would be
    much better than doing it in Po√ßos or Resende.
</p>
<p>
    As for why I was fired, I believe it's because I didn't show enough improvement as a programmer. It's difficult to
    explain exactly what went wrong, but I remember that the work environment was much worse since the head of the
    company decided to be the head of my team, that is to say, my direct boss. It was a very heavy atmosphere, and no
    matter how much he tried to help me, he only made me more nervous and more disappointed with my own skills as a
    programmer. He was quite angry and demanding about everything, but I don't really blame him for that, I know that
    being the leader of anything is a stressful job. I just think he didn't fit in as the team leader.
</p>
<p>
    This led to another problem, the constant need to learn more things that didn't make sense to me. He constantly said
    that I and the other team members should study more, some things that made sense and others that didn't, it was like
    trying to keep up with a moving train. I believe that most jobs are like this, and the higher I go in my career, the
    more I will have to deal with this, but again, part of the problem was precisely that, I didn't know how to deal
    with it and I don't know if I still do. At least now I know more or less about how the job market works, and I'm
    more psychologically prepared. However, I still think I know too little about programming to be able to follow this
    workflow, since even full-fledged programmers have difficulty with this too. Apparently, dealing with this involves
    a compromise between knowledge in the area, dedication to studies, self-improvement and most importantly propaganda.
    A lot of what I saw happening at work was "boss, this new technology will solve 80% of our problems", and then it
    ended up solving 40% and creating more problems. At the end of the day, it was up to the programmers to patch
    everything together to help the Product Managers to advertise the company to the customers.
</p>
<p>
    Now I believe this is the most common work environment in small companies, and especially startups. For me to have
    any chance of standing out in this environment, I need to improve as a self-taught programmer. This was one of the
    reasons that led me to unearth the idea of becoming a freelancer. I believe that the experience of this journey can
    help me solve this problem. Now that I also have a better understanding of the web programming market, I can see a
    little better what I should do to get clients as a freelancer.
</p>
<p>
    It has always been difficult for me to dedicate myself to something that I don't fully understand, my father always
    warned me about this deficiency of mine and I am fully aware of it, but unfortunately it is something that I have no
    control over, and that is why my father keeps taxing me. disobedient without understanding what is actually
    happening.

    control over. That is why my father keeps labeling me as disobedient without understanding what is actually the core
    of the problem. My only option to control this was with methylphenidate, but that option is not on the table for
    now. So, what I can do for my next job is to dedicate myself more to programming, and dedicate myself physically
    too, since I don't know for sure what my life will be like from now on, I need to be prepared for everything.
