    In the vast landscape of database systems, SQL databases stand out as a fundamental tool for storing and managing
    structured data efficiently. While there are various options available, MySQL remains a popular choice due to its
    simplicity, robustness, and widespread adoption. In this beginner's guide, I'll walk through the essentials of
    MySQL, from installation to basic commands, with the minimum requirements for a beginner developer to manage their
    application data.
</p>
<p>- What are SQL Databases?</p>
<p>
    SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for
    managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS). The relational model organizes data into
    tables of rows and columns, allowing for easy retrieval, manipulation, and storage of information.

<p>- Getting Started with MySQL on Windows?</p>
<p>
    To begin your MySQL journey, the first step is to install it on your system. You can follow Amit Think’s tutorial
    video down below, but I'll summarize the process with links and some extra explanations.
</p>
<p>MySQL Windows Install Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4OYk5nKCg</p>
<p>
    You can download the MySQL installer from the official website and follow the installation wizard. Then, you’ll be
    prompted to choose the available products, which you probably won't understand much of what each product is if you
    are a beginner, but basically you’ll select:
</p>
<p>- Latest version of MySQL Server;</p>
<p>- MySQL Workbench (Same version of MySQL Server, or closest to it)</p>
<p>- MySQL Shell (Same version of MySQL Server, or closest to it)</p>
<p>
    From here and on, everything is pretty much “next, next, install”, except that you’ll need to choose a password for
    MySQL root. If you just want to test some code, just go with “admin” and roll with it, you can change later if you
    need to. And that’s it, MySQL is installed and now you should be able to connect your code to the database, and
    access it through the CMD or Workbench.
</p>
<p>- Using Workbench:</p>
<p>
    Once MySQL is installed, you can interact with it using various tools. MySQL Workbench provides a graphical user
    interface (GUI) for managing databases, executing queries, and visualizing data. Additionally, you can use the
    command-line interface (CLI) through CMD or Terminal, which offers more flexibility and control over database
    operations, and I will show how to use it at the end of this tutorial.
</p>
<p>
    What I recommend doing is, if you're a beginner, use workbench first to learn how some commands work, then start
    using the CMD for it. To access the Workbench, just find the MySQL Workbench application and select your MySQL
    Connection. If you just installed it without changing anything during installation, you should have only one, the
    root connection with 3306 port. Just click on it, and type your password (“admin”, you follow what I did to the
    letter), then you should have a screen like this:
</p>
<p>
    You probably don’t have Schemas "portfolioa1", "portfolioa3" though, so, to create your new Schema, right click the
    SCHEMA tab, select Create Schema, give it a name and then apply. This Schema will be our database, apparently
    there’s some difference between the two, but for us, Schema is basically the same as a database.
</p>
<p>
    Open your new Schema, right click on it and click apply, and then apply again on the pop up window with the code on
    it. Notice the code it gives you on the second apply: “CREATE SCHEMA `new_schema_name`;”. This is what the Workbench
    does, it allows you to visualize the codes it writes in the background.
</p>
<p>
    With your Schema/Database ready, create a new table by right click on “Tables” inside your new database. Now, let’s
    pretend we need to create a very basic “user” table that will contain its data. Our table will need: his name, his
    age, his description, and if he is married (a boolean).
</p>
<p>
    First of all, a lot of tables you create will need an Auto Incremented ID, to keep track of every user in this case.
    This ID will also be our Primary Key, so double click the columns first row, and create “id” with those attributes:
</p>
<p>
    For the next row, we want the user’s name. Let’s say we want the length to be a maximum of 45 characters, then our
    data type will be VARCHAR(45). Every string in MySQL needs to have a limit input. For our description, it can be
    VARCHAR(255), or MEDIUMTEXT to allow 16MB of characters.
</p>
<p>
    For the age, we should use INT, just like in programming, it's an integer number. For the marriage status, we want a
    boolean value (true or false), but there’s no such option in our data types. Basically, for that we will need to use
    TINYINT(1), which will only accept 0 or 1, essentially true or false.
</p>
<p>
    There’s a lot more data types available, but these are the ones you should start messing with as a beginner.
    Clicking in apply, it should prompt a code list like this:
</p>
<p>
    Click in apply, and then right click in your table and select “SELECT ROWS - Limit 1000”, and it will show you how
    many users are listed in our “user” table, which should be none by now, because we haven’t inserted any data yet,
    but it's a useful tool for later.
</p>
<p>
    You can insert data manually through the workbench as well, by double clicking the name, age, description columns,
    and then clicking in apply, it will give you a code to insert values on the database. But notice it will not allow
    you to break the rules, such as putting strings in age, which has an Integer data type. This “INSERT INTO” code will
    be the code we will use in the backend when making requests to the database.
</p>
<p>- Connection Parameters and Class Entities with PHP:</p>
<p>
    To connect the PHP application with the Database you created, this is the basic set up code you’ll need:
</p>
<p>
    PHP uses mysqli (MySQL improved) to handle connections to MySQL, so this is all we need to establish a connection.
    Then, to insert data on a table, you can just use the “mysqli $conn” variable to perform a query on the database:
</p>
<p>
    Notice that a mysqli_sql_exception will “catch” if there’s an error in the query. There are other extensions that
    can be used to make that connection, PDO is a famous one that can connect to MySQL and other databases as well.
</p>
<p>- Using CMD:</p>
<p>
    Now that the basics are set up, it's good practice for you to start to access your database through the command
    lines. To do this, open your CMD, and then follow these commands:
</p>
<p>- mysql -u root -p</p>
<p>- show databases;</p>
<p>- use database_name;</p>
<p>- show tables;</p>
<p>- desc my_table_name;</p>
<p>- select * from my_table_name;</p>
<p>
    MySQL serves as an excellent entry point into the realm of SQL databases. By mastering the basic query operations
    and command-line usage, you lay a solid foundation to improve your database skills while continuing to work on your
    codes. The key to proficiency lies in practice and exploration, so dive in, experiment, and let your database
    adventures begin!
