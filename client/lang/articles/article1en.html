    Upon completing a test programming project, I turned my attention to the frontend environment, to explore my options
    for building a decent application as efficiently as possible. Initially, I sought platforms that could provide
    pre-built frontend structures to speed up some of the process, much like I do with backend development using AI.
    However, after experimenting with tools like <a href="https://www.bildr.com/dashboard" target="_blank">Bildr</a>,
    <a href="https://studio.softr.io/dashboard" target="_blank">Softr</a>, and <a href="https://app.versoly.com/"
        target="_blank">Versoly</a>, I realized that the resulting code was unsuitable for customization at best and
    would be a nightmare to work later, as such, what was left for me was to seek alternative approaches.
</p>
<p>
    With the idea of reverse engineering, I started to look at website code mining. By dissecting and analyzing the code
    of a website that caught my eye, I would gain insights about frontend development techniques and best practices. As
    I dug through each line of code, understanding of website architecture and design became clearer, and it was also
    clear that the front end of that particular website was written with Vue.js, but I decided not to use any external
    technologies like Vue, React or Bootstrap for now, and stick to the vanilla approach instead in favor of mastering
    the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
    While mining and polishing that website code, I learned some tricks using CSS and Javascript to handle HTML
    elements. From dynamically toggling HTML element visibility to implementing language and login status-based page
    modifications, each step taken within the code mining had an opportunity to learn something.

    Another feature I found that is worth mentioning was minification, the process of removing all unnecessary
    characters from JavaScript source code without altering its functionality. It creates compressed files intended for
    machine consumption and exposes the importance of code optimization in web development. There are some websites and
    tools that can decompress it, such as <a href="https://unminify.com/" target="_blank">Unminify</a>, but youâ€™ll
    probably end up with a bunch of variables and functions named a, b, c, etc.
</p>
<p>
    As the need to customize icons and images became apparent, I started doing more research on the subject and
    discovered some useful tips and tools such as fontello, a repository that provides free icon packs, SVG drawings
    that allow you to create simple designs with codes, and photoshop. These tools allowed me to customize existing
    icons and create my own when needed to add my own touch of originality and personality.
</p>
<p>
    I did all I could to make my website as original as my skills allowed me to make at the time. Since I have plans to
    create other features such as login and router management and other responsibilities to attend to, I will continue
    to modify its layout as time goes on, improve my front end skills for my personal growth, and write notes of the
    process for future projects.
