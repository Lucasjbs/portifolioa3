    On my journey through the world of web development, once I completed an initial version of my project, I had a
    daunting task of choosing the right web hosting for my site to publish it online. In my quest for the ideal hosting
    platform, I stumbled upon various options, each presenting its own set of challenges.
</p>
<p>
    Initially, I chose to work with AWS, but it wasn’t long until I found myself struggling with its complexity. Despite
    its reputation for scalability and reliability, the labyrinthine interface and absurd amount of services left me
    feeling overwhelmed. Ultimately, I abandoned the idea, realizing that my current level of expertise wasn't yet
    suited to work with it.

    Searching for simplicity, I stumbled upon Render, a promising hosting platform catering to a wide array of
    technologies, including Node.js and Docker. However, my reliance on raw PHP made Render incompatible with my current
    setup. Nevertheless, Render's user-friendly interface and robust features left a good impression, making it an
    option for future projects.
</p>

    At this point, I was feeling too much of a noob, but as I sought for answers in online communities like
    StackOverflow and Reddit, I discovered that both dedicated full fledged developers and novices alike struggled with
    the complexities of web hosting and cloud services. That was even more the case with platforms like AWS and Google
    Cloud, which required a deeper understanding of DevOps principles.

    In the pursuit of a quick and efficient solution for this problem, I turned to 000webhost, a free service offered by
    Hostinger. While lacking most features of premium hosting providers, 000webhost provided all tools I needed to
    upload my website, with a simple environment that I could use to enhance my skills and move to other hosting
    services later on. When using 000webhost's basic features, I soon discovered that the web server configurations and
    http requests were being managed by Apache. I also came to the conclusion that the file management should be done
    using Filezilla to upload file packages because the 000webhost interface can’t upload folders for some reason. This
    web host also provides me with phpmyadmin, so I can connect to the database and insert data and create requests,
    which was important for me.

    With Apache as my web server manager, I had to add some extra configuration to my personal website, via the
    .htaccess file. The .htaccess file is used by the Apache web server to control various aspects of website
    functionality and behavior, in more practical terms, it allows users to override server configuration settings
    without having to edit the main server configuration file. One of the most common uses of .htaccess is URL
    rewriting, which enables developers to create search engine-friendly URLs or implement redirects and URL aliases.
    This is achieved using the Apache mod_rewrite module, and it’s exactly what I needed to allow my index.php file to
    manage URLs. For example, instead of using /tools.html to access the tools page, I just wanted the user to go to
    “/tools” and index.php should handle it accordingly by getting the requested URI with PHP.
</p>

    My experience in search of the appropriate web hosting for my website is a reminder that every setback is an
    opportunity for growth. While the road to web hosting proficiency is still a long way off, as I take on more
    challenges and seek more knowledge in search of answers, the landscape of web development is becoming clearer. We
    need to start somewhere without fear of making ugly mistakes, and learn from it instead while keeping moving
    forward.
