    Mastering the art of session-based CRUD operations is crucial for any backend or full stack web developer. After
    dealing with basic data management and connecting the backend server with the database for a basic CRUD, I quickly
    determined that my next step should be crafting a login system, to transition from creating basic CRUD operations to
    implementing a safe method of authentication. This next project is much more of a challenge, one that shapes the
    importance of robust data handling and communication protocols on all levels of development, but it's a challenge a
    web developer is expected to master.
</p>
<p>
    With authentication came the need to create the same validations and connections to the database that I did in
    previous projects, but this time, it needed heightened validation, error handling mechanisms, and improvement in
    handling my Requests and Responses. By implementing validations on both the client and server sides it was possible
    to notify users of errors such as duplicate email entries, while also warning the user about any inappropriate
    characters before calling the server, ensuring a smoother user experience.
</p>
<p>
    Even after the client successfully submits their request, inappropriate character validations must be implemented on
    the server side as well. The client-side environment is accessible to users and prone to modification in several
    different ways. To avoid vulnerabilities and malicious exploits, it must be assumed that everything on the client
    side can be modified, and everything on the server side however, must not be accessible by the client directly and
    has to be in a separate folder or on another connection port.
</p>
<p>
    An important aspect of backend development lies in organizing the folder structure for development organization and
    even for communication between client and server. With my server side almost entirely written in PHP, I devised a
    structured folder hierarchy to delineate client-side and server-side components. The entrypoint.php script served as
    a bridge for facilitating communication and orchestrating data flow between both sides.

    Efficient route management is paramount for guiding user interactions within the pages. Utilizing PHP superglobal
    variable $_SERVER and the REQUEST_URI data, I simplified route handling through a dedicated router.php script. So
    for example, instead of accessing the file “tools.html” using “/tools.html” in the URL, the user should go to
    “/tools” and “router.php” will handle the request accordingly. Enforcing absolute paths (ex: “/assets”) for website
    assets was also necessary to ensure compatibility across each page, since relative paths (ex: “./assets”) may lose
    track of your assets if your application is managed using the REQUEST_URI data.
</p>
<p>
    It is also essential to understand that this method of route management works by default in the built in PHP server,
    but, if you use Apache server for the final product, you’ll need to use mod_rewrite module in the .htaccess file to
    redirect the routes to index.php file.
</p>
<p>
    Any functional login system requires robust password hashing and session management. There are a number of different
    ways of doing this, but given that I'm using PHP's native functions, I implemented password_hash and password_verify
    to encrypt and verify passwords securely, and at the same time, used session_start() and the $_SESSION[] variable to
    build a secure session management. Since they’re both native to PHP, no additional library was needed.
</p>
<p>
    For the password, as soon as all validations to its string are done, the password is hashed, and then saved in the
    database. When validating, the hashed password is compared using password_verify, without the need to decrypt it
    back. For the Session, as soon as session_start() is declared, a temporary file should be created with a random ID.
    This file should contain the User ID if the user is logged in, and if not, it should be empty. The Client will not
    have access to the ID, he will only have access to his random and hashed file name, making this arrangement
    relatively secure for small applications.
</p>
<p>
    The implementation of a functional login system using PHP's native tools is an important step in the career path of
    a web developer. As there are still many new tools, languages, and frameworks to explore, I believe only practice
    and dedication will allow a developer to create resilient and efficient web applications in the long run.
